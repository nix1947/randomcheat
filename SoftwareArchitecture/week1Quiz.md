Question 1
Which of these are desirable characteristics of a software design? Choose the three correct answers.


maintainability

Correct
Correct! Code should be maintainable, which means the code can be modified or extended easily.


flexible

Correct
Correct! We strive to make code flexible, which is to say that it can be adapted for new requirements


tight coupling


reusability

Correct
Correct! Software designers hate to repeat themselves. If code is reusable, then there is less overall coding to do.

2.
Question 2
Identify two outcomes of the design process. Choose the two correct answers.

1 / 1 point

code implementation


design plan


technical design

Correct
Correct! Technical design gets even closer to the actual implementation.


conceptual design

Correct
Correct! Conceptual design covers the early part of design, where the problem is translated into a high-level solution.

3.
Question 3
You are writing out a CRC card for a bank machine component. Under which section should you put "Track Cash Remaining."

1 / 1 point

Risk


Collaborator


Class


Responsibility

Correct
Correct! One of the responsibilities of this bank machine is to track how much money it has left.

4.
Question 4
Which two of these are likely to be a part of conceptual design?

1 / 1 point

Mockups

Correct
Correct! Mockups help the designers decide on relationships between components.


Abstract data types


CRC Cards

Correct
Correct! CRC cards are used to get a sense of the classes, components, etc. that your design may have.


Methods

5.
Question 5
When during the design process are you likely to produce CRC cards the most?

1 / 1 point

customer meetings


conceptual design


after releasing the software


technical design

Correct
Correct! CRC cards are most often created and used in conceptual design, especially when the team is almost ready to transition into technical design.

6.
Question 6
Which of the following are examples of non-functional requirements? Choose the three correct answers.

1 / 1 point

security

Correct
Correct. The security of a system and how it protects data may be as important as its function. Remember that the function is the system's reason for being.


availability

Correct
Correct! That the functions of the system are available for use is as important as the functions themselves. Remember that the function is the system's reason for being.


performance

Correct
Correct. The speed and responsiveness of a system is often as important as what its actual function is! Remember that the function is the system's reason for being.


purpose

7.
Question 7
Select the three categories of objects generally present in object-oriented software.

1 / 1 point

entity

Correct
Correct! Entity objects are the backbone of the system, and often correspond to real life objects.


tool


boundary

Correct
Correct! Boundary objects typically interface with another system.


control

Correct
Correct! Control objects manage the interactions of other objects.

8.
Question 8
An object which is responsible for showing data to the user could be considered which category of object?

1 / 1 point

boundary


entity


representation


control

Correct
Correct! This object interacts with another "system" (the user), so it is considered a boundary object.

9.
Question 9
You are planning a Professor class as part of your software design. Which of these will you consider a collaborator ? Choose the two correct answers.

1 / 1 point

Teach Course


Student

Correct
Correct! The student and professor classes will likely be collaborators.


Track Employment Status


Course

Correct
Correct! Typically the Professor will have to teach a course, so a course object is likely to be a collaborator.

10.
Question 10
What is a requirement of this form called? "As a ____, I want to ____, so that ____".

1 / 1 point

entity abstraction


key concept


conceptual mockup


user story

Correct
Correct! User stories help you to identify the functional requirements of the system.

11.
Question 11
You are a programmer creating software for a bank machine system. Which section of a CRC card for the bank machine component will the "User" go into?

1 / 1 point

Responsibility


Collaborator


Object


Class

Correct
Correct! Users collaborate with the bank machine component.

12.
Question 12
During conceptual design, you will talk about... (Choose the three correct answers):

1 / 1 point

requirements

Correct
Correct! Customer requirements of what the system should be and do are the start for all discussions of the design.


mockups

Correct
Correct. Mockups are important for customer communication and to start to think about the architecture.


tradeoffs

Correct
Correct. Every design decision involves trade-offs, even in the early stages of design.
